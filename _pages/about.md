Short bibliography
Earlier work has been on physiological and behavioral responses to heat stress in leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens). Currently, I am studying how chironomids (Diptera, Chironomidae) mechanistically respond to various environmental stressors.
Some of the species that I have worked with include: Belgica antarctica, Eretmoptera murphyi and Telmatogeton magellanicus.
Some of the stressors that I have worked on include: cold (and freezing), heat, osmotic and dehydration stress.
Major fields of interest include: ecology, physiology, ecological genomics
Minor fields of interest include: phenotypic plasticity, multiomics
