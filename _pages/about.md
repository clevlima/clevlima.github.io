Cleverson de Sousa Lima

PhD Candidate, University of Kentucky

Research at a glance: I am interested in organismal responses to environmental stress, particularly within the context of extreme environments.

Short biography:

Earlier work has been on physiological and behavioral responses to heat stress in leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens). Currently, I am studying how chironomids (Diptera, Chironomidae) mechanistically respond to various environmental stressors.

Some of the species that I have worked with include: Belgica antarctica, Eretmoptera murphyi and Telmatogeton magellanicus.

Some of the stressors that I have worked on include: cold (and freezing), heat, osmotic and dehydration stress.

Major fields of interest include: ecology, physiology, genomics

Minor fields of interest include: phenotypic plasticity, acclimation, multiomics

Personal goal: As a scientist, my objective is working towards a more complete understanding of how organisms respond to environmental change.
